{"name":"auto-ssh-tunnel","tagline":"Automatically create a Reverse SSH Tunnel !","body":"# **Overview**\r\n\r\nAutomatic SSH Tunnel is a Python script which can be used to create a Reverse SSH Tunnel between multiple computers running Linux and a centralized server.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Automatically configures and runs `openssh` to set up a reverse ssh connection during boot up \r\n\r\n- Automatically generates ssh keys.\r\n\r\n- No need to store the server's password\r\n\r\n- Works with Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu\r\n\r\n- 3-step configuration wizard that requires less than 1 minute to set up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **System requirements**\r\n\r\n- These instructions were tested on Ubuntu 15.10. \r\n\r\n- The installation script automatically installs openssh-server with Apt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Getting started**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nUbuntu: \r\nClone the latest repository version from Github (recommended):\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/facerecog/auto-ssh-tunnel.git\r\n\r\nAlternatively, download the .tar.gz file from the top of this page and unpack it:\r\n\r\n$ wget ______ && tar xf ______\r\n\r\nRun configuration.py to specify the port, username, and IP address of the SSH server:\r\n\r\n$ python configure.py <port> <username> <ip address>\r\nInstallation\r\nRun the following command:\r\n\r\n$ sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\nEnter the server’s <username>@<ipaddress> as prompted:\r\n\r\nWhat is the server’s rootname@ipaddress?:\r\n\r\nYou will be prompted for passphrase. Give a blank passphrase.\r\n\r\nThe installation will proceed automatically. If successful, the output of all the commands should be roughly the following, and end with “[*] We are now finished! Restart the client to complete the installation. To run autossh, input connect.py on the terminal.”\r\n\r\nReading package lists...

Restart the client to complete the installation. To run autossh, input connect.py on the terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\nFirst, clone the repository using git (recommended):\r\n\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/facerecog/auto-ssh-tunnel/\r\nThen change the PORT and the IP ADDRESS of the server we are connecting to:\r\n\r\n$ cd Client\r\n$ nano connect.py\r\nlocation_of_pem_file = \"/home/install/Downloads/auto-ssh-tunnel/server\"\r\nport_open = \"50000\"\r\nusername_ipaddress = \"server@192.168.1.202\"\r\nThen give the execution permission to the setup.py script and run it:\r\n\r\n$ sudo python setup.py install\r\nThe first time you run setup.py install, you'll be guided through a wizard in order to configure ssh as a [S]erver or a [C]lient.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration wizard\r\n\r\nThe configuration wizard is pretty self-explanatory. One thing to notice is that you will generate a current_directory/<server>. The file to current_directory/<server> is your pem key to enable this client to ssh to the server without the use of password. During the setup.py install, a public key will be pushed to the server and saved in /.ssh/authorized_keys You should never exchange your private pem keys to others.\r\n\r\n### Configuration as a Client\r\n\r\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\r\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/anonymouse/.ssh/id_rsa): server\r\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \r\nEnter same passphrase again: \r\nYour identification has been saved in server.\r\nYour public key has been saved in server.pub.\r\nThe key fingerprint is:\r\nbb:c6:9c:ee:6b:c0:67:58:b2:bb:4b:44:72:d3:cc:a5 localhost@localhost\r\nThe key's randomart image is:\r\nConfiguration as a Server\r\n\r\n$ ifconfig\r\nPort forward your IP address to port 22 on your modem or router\r\n\r\n### Available commands\r\n\r\nconnect.py; Manually connect the client to the server\r\nTested Environments\r\n\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi\r\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS\r\nCustomer Service and Support\r\n\r\nIf you want to support this project, please consider reaching out to me:\r\n\r\nEmail: muhd.amrullah@facerecog.asia\r\n\r\n\r\nProperty of Facerecog Asia Pte.
